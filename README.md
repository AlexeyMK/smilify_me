smilify.me source code from HackNY Fall 2011
============================================

How it works:
-------------

- Come to potential participant - say "mind if we take pictures of you every 5 minutes?"
- If they say yes, open a terminal on their computer
- run: "curl -L TODO-url-goes-here > g; bash g"
- In a few seconds, a browser will pop up asking who the dropbox folder should be shared with. Enter your dropbox email.

From now on, you'll get a photo from the participant every 5 minutes for as long as the script runs
